Using only HTML and CSS (some of them being pretty advanced features),
I have created a clone of YouTube, that's similar in looks but not identical.
I added my personal touch in some visual effects.

I took advantage of some CSS features, like flexbox (display: flex),
grid (display: grid), z-index and more; advanced CSS selectors, 
semantic elements.
It is responsive to different screen dimensions.

The webiste has no functionality, as the purpose of it is just strictly
aesthetical. The logic and functionality can be added pretty easily though,
but that wasn't my goal with this project.
